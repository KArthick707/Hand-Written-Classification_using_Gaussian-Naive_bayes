# Hand-Written-Classification_using_Gaussian-Naive_bayes

In this code I have used Gaussian Naive Bayes classification model to classify Hand written digits. This is an image classfication
where I am finding the given metrics like Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Precision, Recall and  F1-score. I also find the Macroaverage for precision, recall and f1-score.
